# Rock-Paper-Scissors-project

## Description

The aim of this project is to build a rock-paper-scissors game using a deep learning model. The computer will choose its own sign (out of rock, paper and scissors) then detect the hand sign shown by the user using the camera.

## Gameplay
- Begin the game by running the program.
- The program will prompt you to input a sign, either 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'.
- The program will then randomly choose its own sign.
- The program will then tell you the result of the game, either 'You won!', 'You lost!', or 'It is a tie'.
- To start a new game, just run the program again.


## Instalation instructions

The program uses the imported module 'random'. The 'random' module is pre-installed in python.
